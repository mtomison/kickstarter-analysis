# Kickstarter Fundraising Analysis

## Overview of Project
A play, **Fever**, while coming very close to its fundraising goals in a short amount of time, was unsuccessful. To get the best possible outcomes for future projects, some analysis was done of various fundraising campaigns around the world.

### Purpose

Analysis was done of other fundraisers to determine trends around the success or failure of other campaigns. There were several variables that were reviewed including, time of year, fundraising goal, and narrowing it down to ‘Theater’ category and 'Plays' sub-category. We took data from multiple countries of fundraisers for various projects such as 'file & video', 'games', 'publishing', and 'theater' to name just a few. We looked at how many succeeded, failed, and were canceled as well as looking at the launch month to find any possible correlation to a better time of year to launch a fundraising campaign as well as if the overall goal could be a factor in success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We started our analysis around the launch date, looking for a trend on what month of the year might be best for launching a new fundraising campaign. We narrowed our focus on the Parent Category of ‘Theater’ and how many campaigns were successful, failed or were canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Now, looking at the outcomes based on the fundraising goals, we grouped them at $5000 increments. We eliminated any current fundraising campaign that is still live and only looked at fundraisers in support of a play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results

> What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- 
>What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
>What are some limitations of this dataset?
>What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

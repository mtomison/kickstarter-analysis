# Kickstarter Fundraising Analysis

## Overview of Project
A play, *Fever*, while coming very close to its fundraising goals in a short amount of time, was unsuccessful. To get the best possible outcomes for future projects, some analysis was done of various fundraising campaigns around the world.

### Purpose

Analysis was done of other fundraisers to determine trends around the success or failure of other campaigns. There were several variables that were reviewed including, time of year, fundraising goal, and narrowing it down to ‘Theater’ category and 'Plays' sub-category. We took data from multiple countries of fundraisers for various projects such as 'file & video', 'games', 'publishing', and 'theater' to name just a few. We looked at how many succeeded, failed, and were canceled as well as looking at the launch month to find any possible correlation to a better time of year to launch a fundraising campaign as well as if the overall goal could be a factor in success or failure.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We started our analysis around the launch date, looking for a trend on what month of the year might be best for launching a new fundraising campaign. We narrowed our focus on the Parent Category of ‘Theater’ and how many campaigns were successful, failed or were canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Now, looking at the outcomes based on the fundraising goals, we grouped them at $5000 increments. We eliminated any current fundraising campaign that is still live and only looked at fundraisers in support of a play.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

> What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- With a ratio of 2 to 1, the most successful fundraising campaigns were launched in May and June, therefore May is the best month with June right behind it.
- Launching in December, the number of successful campaigns was roughly the same as those that failed, so it is not recommended to launch a campaign in December.
>What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Based on the numbers analyzed, the smaller amounts were unsurprisingly more likely to be funded. Less than $1000 was 76% likely to be funded, while fundraisers with a goal between $1000 and $4999 was 73% likely to be funded. Surprisingly, 2/3 of fundraising campaigns with goals between $35000 and $44999 were fully funded. 
>What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The data is 4 to 12 years old.  More current data would be better.
- While we have the countries, having regions and/or cities might be useful.
>What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- While it was concluded that May and June were the most successful launch months, I think comparing that to the amount to determine a cross section of both launch date and the goal and the success rate of those two parameters
- We looked at how many were funded, but looking at the ones that exceeded their funding might help to determine the goal to set for future campaigns.
